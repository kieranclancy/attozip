attozip - an extremely compact and minimal "zip" (non-)implementation
          2012 Kieran Clancy <clancy DOT kieran AT gmail>

attozip is an attempt to write the smallest possible POSIX compliant*
program that can create "zip" files. More than anything it was just a
fun project, but I thought I'd release the code since others may find
it useful for embedded projects etc.

features: 0% compression ratio! (that's right. none. by design.)
          has no user controllable options
          reasonable error handling, surprisingly
          cowardly refuses to overwrite existing files
          very minimal reliance on library functions
          works on both little/big-endian*

If you do end up using this for something, I'd be interested to hear
about it from you - drop me an email?  I'm releasing this code under
the GPLv3 license (see LICENSE file).
